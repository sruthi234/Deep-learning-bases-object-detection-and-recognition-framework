# Deep-Learning-Based-Object-Detection-and-Recognition-Framework--
ABSTRACT:

This paper aims at combining object detection at real time and recognition with suitable deep learning methods in order to detect and recognize objects position as well as the names of multiple objects detected by the camera using an Object detector algorithm. This is to aid the visually impaired user without the help of any other person. The image and video processing algorithms were designed to take real-time inputs from the camera; Deep Neural Networks were used to predict the objects and uses Googleâ€™s famous Text-To-Speech (GTTS) API module for the anticipated voice output precisely detecting and recognizing the category or class of  objects  and locations  contained.  Our  best  result  shows  that  the  system  recognizes  91 categories of outdoor objects and produces the output in speech i.e. in an audio format even when a reduced amount of spectral Information from the data is available
